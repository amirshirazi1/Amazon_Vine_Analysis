The compilation contains only the six A-sides and six cover tunes, and none of the reworkings.  Also included is a bonus live track and a bonus demo dating back to sometime in the 90s.<br /><br />The new songs are all in Marshall's later mode: mid-tempo, sometimes downbeat, often with a wryly reflective point of view.  As well, the well-scrubbed pop hooks of thirty years ago are now much more subtle, and may take a few spins to sink in.  Unfortunately, the album isn't well served by putting all six of these originals back-to-back to lead off the album, as the tone of each of these six songs is somewhat similar, and it makes the album seem more monochromatic than it actually is.<br /><br />The seven covers (including the live bonus track) are a little more stylistically diverse, ranging from some rock-oriented Everly Brothers material to an achingly sincere &#34;Close To You&#34;.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing absolutely revelatory about #392, but the album is still chock full of good songcraft performed with skill and passion.  If you're a long-term Crenshaw fan, this is a worthwhile purchase.  But if you're just getting in to Mr. Crenshaw's work?  I would say that there are other albums (Downtown, Life's Too Short, Marshall Crenshaw) that show him to greater advantage -- explore those ones first.

The music on this dual CD was recorded on 22 January 1975 at Shinjuku Kohseinenkin Hall in Tokyo, 10 days before the Agharta/Pangaea concerts in Osaka on 1st February. The Tokyo performance was originally recorded as an FM radio broadcast to be aired only in Japan, and includes different material to the Osaka concerts.<br /><br />The band has the same line-up as Agharta/Pangea: Miles; two electric guitarists, Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas; percussionist James Mtume Heath; young bass player Michael Henderson (who Miles stole from Stevie Wonder’s backing band!); Sonny Fortune on sax & flute, and drummer Al Foster.<br /><br />If you like Agharta/Pangea, you’re going to like this: the band is in the same raunchy jazz/funk groove. Much of the performance is dominated by high-energy interplay between Cosey and Lucas, and Miles’ contributions to the sound are often played through a wah-wah pedal. Throughout Miles’ electric-fusion period 1969-75 no two performances were the same but each had structure, guided by Miles as band director as the music unfolds. As on Agharta/Pangea it’s obvious that this band knows its business, but no-one knew in advance when the changes would happen or where the music would go.<br /><br />In a 2015 essay on Miles’ fusion/funk period, Angus Batey writes that the listener can best appreciate this music if s/he has “the ability to grasp the plan and understand the context for, and the nature of, these still shockingly futuristic and unequalled sounds…Miles and his 1975 band fusing jazz, rock and funk into a seamless, satisfying and richly rewarding whole”.<br /><br />If you don’t know the Agharta/Pangea concerts but you do know ‘A Tribute to Jack Johnson’ and especially ‘Dark Magus’, you’re in essentially the same territory here. This is the raunchiest and funkiest territory in the vast continent of Miles Davis’ unequalled musical legacy. It’s regrettable that no-one is taking risks in exploring unknown musical landscapes like this in the 21st century.of Miles Davis’ unequalled musical legacy.

I was really disappointed when the release got pushed out to the end of August, but I wanted my own copy of Shut Up and Fish so much I waited it out. Not at all disappointed that I did, I really like the whole album. Was playing it with my sister in the car and commented that they reminded my a lot of the Dixie Chicks and she said&#34; I thought that is who it was!&#34; Having never heard the song before, she was singing along to the chorus of Shut Up before the it was over. Stay on Your Side of Town is in the vein of Sin Wagon, one of my all time favorite DC songs and I smile every time I listen to it again.<br /><br />Of course, the radio hits are there too, like &#34;Girl in a Country Song&#34; and &#34;Fly&#34;, but really, every song on this album could be a hit. The lyrics are clever and memorable. The harmony is great, the songs have real melodies and genuine country feel with fiddle, banjo and (I believe) steel guitar making contributions, and there are some pretty good regular guitar parts too.<br /><br />I never feel like these girls are screaming at me, a common problem with many of the &#34;big&#34; female country stars in my opinion. Another reviewer pegged the target audience as kids to 20's, but I'm in my 50's and my wife and sister in their 60's and we all liked it.

I found out about her today from browsing new music and just after hearing a few songs, I'm hooked. She gives me Amy Winehouse/Adele/old soul/jazz vibes and I love it.

As you can imagine - guitar-heroes who were 'Irish' could be typed on a very small piece of paper indeed. But man oh man when we stumped up our candidate for selection – Ireland produced a proper goodun.<br /><br />So what of this much-anticipated reissue? As much as I worship the ground Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster walked on – this 2015 Universal 4CD Reissue is both good and awful in very equal measures. The good news is that the PASCHAL BYRNE remasters of the two studio albums are off-the-wall good. Byrne has a long and distinguished history as an Audio Engineer having handled the &#34;Spirit Of Joy&#34; Polydor 3CD Box Set and hundreds of other quality reissues for Universal and Esoteric Recordings over the last decade. But I'm sensing awards are in order because the boy has excelled himself here. The audio on the two albums is fabulous – the best I've ever heard - and I've known and loved these LPs for over 45 years. The Previously Unreleased outtakes from those studio efforts are also genuinely worth having too – stuff that will make blind men see, preachers lay their Bibles down and even persuade politicians to go straight (well lets not ask for too much shall we).<br /><br />But (all puns aside) Discs 3 and 4 are a different matter. The very well-recorded Swedish gig is electrifying (it really is) but the 'Off Air' &#34;BBC Live In Concert&#34; stuff that finishes off Disc 3 is virtually unlistenable – poor bootleg standard at best. And the fact that an exclusive song like &#34;Feel So Good&#34; on the officially released &#34;Live Taste&#34; and &#34;Live At The Isle Of Wight&#34; LPs from 1971 and 1972 has been replaced with this lesser stuff will only rub salt into the wounds for fans. Disc 4 is not much better - the 'Belfast Sessions' are Demos notoriously inflicted with tape dropouts on almost all tracks that 'has not' been fixed - so they're curio value at best rather than a pleasurable listen. In fairness to the makers of the box – this stuff is included of course for completeness and some of the earlier tracks are actually worth listening to. But if they're audibly damaged – then why include them at all. The Major Minor single is crap and the Woburn stuff good rather than great (a very so-so recording). In truth - had this been a 3CD set containing the Swedish gig and the stragglers not duplicated from the official live albums slapped on at the end of Disc 3 – then it would have been perfect. As it is – I know I'll only be playing those first two discs and the live Swedish gig off the 3rd – and ditching the inferior rest.

Produced by Donal and Daniel Gallagher (his family) alongside Joe Black – the superbly detailed sleeve notes are by NIGEL WILLIAMSON and go into Rory’s early days in Belfast at The Maritime Club (Taste took over residency from Van Morrison's Them) on to their first reference on a London billboard (August 1967 as a support act to Robert Hirst at The Marquee) and even meeting John Peel in a transport caf&eacute; (he remained a huge fan of Gallagher for years). Pages 28 to 29 are festooned with photographs I’ve never seen before of the young band in Cork, on their way to a date Scotland, tours with Traffic, sharing the Bill with Roger Chapman’s Family at the Camden Roundhouse and so on. There’s even a very old newspaper clipping of a happy Rory amidst a bunch of Cork hopefuls on a 'Spot The Talent' show smiling beneath a Mrs. Mary Carey-O'Mahony who had to be 75 if not a day! It's properly great stuff and affectionate too...the only error I can see is that a Danish titled picture sleeve of &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; is credited as a UK release when it never had a picture sleeve in this country.<br /><br />SINGLES:<br />Eagle-eyed fans will know that the first Taste 45 was &#34;Blister On The Moon&#34; b/w &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; on Major Minor Records MM 560 in April 1968 (long before they had an album) – and both cuts were different mixes to the re-recorded versions that turned up on the debut LP in 1969. Although it doesn’t state it directly on the packaging (it is mentioned in the excellent booklet) - they are here on Disc 4, Tracks 8 and 9 as part of ‘The Belfast Sessions’. That whole recording was issued in the UK as a Rory Gallagher LP called &#34;In The Beginning&#34; on Emerald Records GES 1100 in 1974 (it was later subject to successful prosecution). The only officially released British Polydor single came when the label put out the newly recorded LP cut of &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; b/w &#34;Same Old Story&#34; as a first 7&#34; single on Polydor 56313 in March 1969. But in that strange way that Polydor didn't support the first Stone The Crows LP with a 45 when they should have done – Polydor didn't bother to plug the 2nd Taste LP &#34;On The Boards&#34; with a single either although &#34;What's Going On&#34; was an obvious choice. In fact that track flipped with &#34;Railway And Gun&#34; and &#34;If I Don't Sing, I'll Cry&#34; b/w &#34;I'll Remember&#34; were both released as 7&#34; singles in many European countries (a set of those picture sleeves adorns the last page of the attached booklet).<br /><br />STUDIO LPS:<br />Produced by Tony Colton - the debut LP opens with a belter - &#34;Blister On The Moon&#34; - and immediately I'm hit with the quality remaster – the bass and drums so clear. We now get the first of the album's four cover versions – Huddie &#34;Leadbelly&#34; Ledbetter's &#34;Leavin' Blues&#34; which sounds incredible – that strangely sparse slide sound he’s getting. The other three covers are a grungy (and hissy) &#34;Sugar Mama&#34; by Howlin' Wolf, his amazing cut of Robert Petway's 1941 Bluebird Records stalwart &#34;Catfish&#34; and a Countrified shuffle through Hank Snow's &#34;I'm Moving On” (the rest are Gallagher compositions). His acoustic-only &#34;Hail&#34; sounds incredible while it's easy to hear why the re-recording of &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; was an obvious single. “Dual Carriageway Pain” was badly recorded in my opinion and still sounds strangely tame - as if the song just needed to let rip somehow to infuse it with some genuine excitement. The same unfortunately applies to &#34;Same Old Story&#34; – a good tune hampered by a weedy recording. But then we get a true monster and surely why Hendrix was so impressed by Gallagher - his cover of &#34;Catfish&#34;. Hendrix recorded &#34;Catfish&#34; himself in a similar 8-minute Bluesy vein (It was finally released as &#34;Catfish Blues&#34; on the superb &#34;Blues&#34; CD from 1994). It's as if Gallagher knew that something needed to be done – so he cranks the amps up to 90 and does an 8-minute Blues Rock thrashing of &#34;Catfish&#34;. With heavy riffs like he's auditioning for Led Zeppelin - you can hear the amps rumbling in the background – his playing inspired because the structure of the song allows him to let go. It's a standout on an otherwise strangely tame debut LP...<br /><br />The 2nd album &#34;On The Boards&#34; is an entirely different beast to the first – so much more sophisticated and filled with far better songs (all Rory originals). Again produced by Tony Colton but Engineered by Eddie Offord (late of Yes fame) – the audio is brilliant and the remaster absolutely brings that to life. &#34;What's Going On&#34; has always made me throw undignified shapes around my living room with a tennis racket (still does) – but little prepared me for the stunning audio on Bluesy &#34;Railway And Gun&#34; and the jazzy &#34;It's Happened Before, It'll Happen Again&#34; (Rory gives the Alto Saxophone a rare outing on this one). The Fleetwood Mac &#34;Then Play On&#34; boogie of &#34;Morning Sun&#34; is wicked too. The Johnny Winter style cool slide of &#34;Eat My Words&#34; sounds awesome, as does Rory's clever Harmonica inclusion on &#34;If The Day Was Any Longer&#34; (again with gorgeous Audio).<br /><br />LIVE STUFF:<br />A six-minute &#34;What's Going On&#34; allows Rory to stretch out and get the crowd going but it’s the fabulous Blues Rock riffage of &#34;Sugar Mama&#34; that gets them clapping and screaming. He does a wicked electric slide version of Melvin Jackson's &#34;Gamblin' Blues&#34; where he sounds like Mike Bloomfield enjoying himself even though &#34;...my woman eat me out of house and home...&#34; We then get a track that would eventually turn up in studio form on his 1971 debut solo LP – &#34;Sinner Boy&#34;. He slows it down with a 'new one' called &#34;At The Bottom&#34; which features his Harmonica playing (he would eventually record it for 1975's &#34;Against The Grain&#34;). Next up is a very cool version of Muddy Waters' &#34;She's Nineteen Years Old&#34; which has the crowd clapping to its salacious Blues beat – a great inclusion. It's followed by a forgotten nugget from &#34;On The Boards&#34; – a huge rocking version of &#34;Morning Sun&#34; fully brought to life in the live environment where Taste suddenly sound like a four-piece band and not just a trio. And it ends on the crowd-pleaser Blues-Rock of &#34;Catfish&#34; sounding every bit as powerful as the debut LP version – hair-raising note bending and all that. This is Heavy Hard Rock and I love it...<br /><br />After the high of the Swedish recording – the BBC tracks come as a truly dreadful disappointment – they’re no better than a bad bootleg recording and even though &#34;Eat My Words&#34; is electrifying in all its slide-guitar glory – the audio makes it virtually unlistenable. Disc 4 offers some solace in 1967 demos of Big Joe Turner's &#34;Wee Wee Baby&#34;, Howlin' Wolf's &#34;How Many More Years&#34; and a wicked Bluesy version of Sonny Boy Williamson's &#34;Take It Easy Baby&#34; which stretches to 7:13 minutes. The bad news is that those three-or-four-second tape drop-outs on &#34;How Many More Years&#34;, &#34;Pardon Me Mister&#34;, &#34;You've Got To Pay&#34;, &#34;Norman Invasion&#34; (a three-minute instrumental) and &#34;Worried Man&#34; are still there making the listen a curio rather than a genuine pleasure. The Major Minor single versions of &#34;Blister On The Moon&#34; and &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; in Mono sound strictly amateur-hour compared to their 1969 Polydor re-recordings and the Woburn Abbey gig is good rather than great. All in all – there's too much of Disc 3 and 4 that's dismissible. So there you have it – a very mixed bag - but I have to say that I’m lapping up the remasters of the studio albums and their alternate versions.<br /><br />Once asked what’s it like to be seen as the greatest guitar player in the world – Jimi Hendrix reputedly replied, &#34;I don't know. You should ask Rory Gallagher...&#34; And at least parts of this &#34;I'll Remember&#34; 4CD release hammer home why the mighty Jimi was such an admirer...let) - they are here on Disc 4, Tracks 8 and 9 as part of ‘The Belfast Sessions’.

Well, I chose to take a chunk of time out of my busy day and do just that because I feel like I need to let as many people as possible know about this truly amazing music collection.  I suffer with deep recurring depression. So I did what every trusting, good patient does and filled my script for the antidepressant prozac and it gave me these really bad headaches in the back of my head. I &#34;googled&#34; it and apparently, that's a pretty  commons side-effect.  I started with just playing it one disc after another in order and the music was really good.  Normally, I like classic rock and metal, but this stuff sort of spoke to me.  I know that sounds cray-cray but it's true.  One night I couldn't sleep (another wonderful side-effect of the medication) had that headache again too. well, I fell right to sleep never even made it through the first disc!  I woke up feeling pretty good too.  So I decided to try something (and I'm sorry this is so long but I want to be honest with you). I stopped taking my meds and decided to see if this healing stuff was for real.  That was 2 weeks ago and I haven't taken another pill since.  Headaches are gone. I feel good and I'm now convinced that this music and Michael S. Tyrell are the real deal.  It comes with a really goo dbook written by Michael too. It explains how this project came to be and how God Himself inspires Michael to help people every day.  But you don't have to be religious to dig this stuff. It works for people no matter what their background is.  Give it a try, the worst that could happen is that you’ll get your money back if you don’t like it! But I bet it makes you feel great like it did me.

From the very beginning, they’ve succeeded in making rawness and ugliness sound appealing. So even as Lemmy’s voice has grown wheezier over the past few years, it matters not; as long as it fits the band’s gritty sound, they can work this imperfection in their favour. But that’s not to say that his singing isn’t good on this album. The man can still hit the high notes when needed; the unexpected key change at the end of “Shoot Out All of Your Lights” extinguishes all doubt in that area.<br /><br />The snarl and attitude is still 100% present in the vocals as well, which is made immediately apparent with the first track “Victory or Die” – a truly blistering opening statement which aims to convince each and every listener that Motörhead have no intentions of toning it down in spite of their age. “Thunder and Lightning” follows, and steps things up a notch with a faster tempo, a greater intensity, and more memorable moments. It’s at this stage where listeners can stop worrying about whether or not this great band can still deliver, and instead just sit back and enjoy the rest of the album with confidence that they’re in for quite a ride.<br /><br />Next comes “Fire Storm Hotel”, providing some welcome variation with its groovy ZZ Top-type groove and super catchy vocal melody. The riff is actually kinda like a variation of Top’s “Sharp Dressed Man”, in a similar way to how “No Class” bears resemblance to “Tush”, though perhaps not quite as closely.<br /><br />“Shoot Out All of Your Lights” follows, and pretty much eclipses everything the album has offered up until this point, and unfortunately casts a shadow over the three lesser tracks that succeed it. “The Devil” and “Evil Eye” turn out to be quite unmemorable by comparison, and “Electricity” basically is just “Smiling Like a Killer” reincarnate, so it automatically loses points for self-plagiarism. On reflection, however, as standalone tracks they’re all quite good. “The Devil” packs a decent punch and has a truly blazing solo from Queen’s Brian May; “Electricity” is still a damn fun rock n’ roll song; and “Evil Eye” has a pumping rhythm, a memorable vocal melody, and an awesome low, growly vocal delivery from Lemmy.<br /><br />All the shortcomings that those few tracks may have had are quickly forgotten as the next track, “Teach Them How to Bleed”, thunders in and gets this album well-and-truly back on track. It’s a fast-paced, relentless steamroller of a song accompanied by some intelligent lyrics. I can’t tell you what most of them mean, but they’re well-worded and full of cynicism and swagger: “Give the people what they want / Blood and death and guts / People so predictable / Drive you f*cking nuts”. What kicks the song further into action, though, is the truly climactic layered solo from Phil Campbell. It comes in half-way through, spends 40 seconds kicking arse, and then leaves the remainder of the song sounding stronger and more vital as a result.<br /><br />And, on that note, it should be said that Phil really is the hero on this album. There isn’t a bad solo on this LP, and on more than one occasion it’s his fiery fretwork that lifts a song out of its potential mediocrity, and transforms everything else from good songs into fantastic songs. This man’s fingers have not aged since the day he joined this band, and the mind that controls them has only grown more inventive and musically articulate. To borrow some adjectives from “In the Year of the Wolf”, his playing is mean and vicious, fast and clever. Album after album, he never fails to impress.<br /><br />“Teach Them How to Bleed” is followed up by the truly grand “Till the End” – a slow-paced, ballad-y reflection on the life from Lemmy’s perspective. It’s a meaningful, cynical, honest, sober song with a tone that is sombre without being defeatist, and personal without being pompous. It’s beautiful, really, and earns a place amongst Motörhead’s classics.<br /><br />After this is “Tell Me Who to Kill”, which underwhelms a little, but features some cool bass lines, and a guitar solo that resembles and rivals that of Brian May’s on “The Devil”. This song is, however, the last of the album’s few low points, as the final three tracks produce nothing but brilliance. “Choking on Your Screams” is delightfully fearsome and dark, both lyrically and musically. “When the Sky Come Looking for You” then comes in with a much more upbeat sound and elevates things to yet another level. The lyrics paint an awesome picture, the chorus sticks with you instantly after one listen, the performance of Mikkey Dee demonstrates exactly why he’s considered one of the best drummers in the business, and the band just seem to have an amazing overall chemistry with each other. The production should not go without mention either. Speaking of chemistry, Cameron Webb just seems to know this band so well now, bringing the best out of their sound time and time again.<br /><br />“When the Sky Come Looking for You” is another song that could easily find a place on Motörhead’s ever-growing list of classics. My only gripe with it is that it could do with a better end. It seems to be a bit of a running theme on this album, where the songs just end so abruptly. One should never underestimate the power of a good ending - something that shows a bit of imagination. They’ve done it in the past. One which comes to mind is the slow, monstrous-sounding crush of the final chords in “The Thousand Names of God” (which always pissed me off when performed live, because they never seemed to nail that ending!) from 2008’s 'Motörizer'. Another is “Trigger” from 2006’s ‘Kiss of Death’, which finishes with a bluesy lick, a pause, and then a quick reprise of one of the song’s main riffs. I would’ve loved to have heard more of this sort of thing on ‘Bad Magic’.<br /><br />Luckily the ending of final track is immensely satisfying. I wasn’t sure if it was such a good idea to cap off the album with a cover, but Motörhead take “Sympathy for the Devil” and give it so much life, vigour, power, and personal flair that it becomes a perfect closer to ‘Bad Magic’. It’s such a joyous, stylish rendition of a song that many rock fans hold close to their hearts. The band sounds like they’re having a world of fun playing it, and the outro sounds truly celebratory. It’s a great end to a great album, and if it is to be their last, then it’ll be a great end to a great career. That’s a notion that I hate to ponder, though. I want this band to keep going forever. I foolishly want the immortality myths to be true. This band has been such a constant in the lives of so many, and a reliable source of timeless, stimulating music. This album proves that we can trust this band to deliver, even in adverse circumstances. Motörhead has earned their loyal following in the fairest way possible, and we’re damn well gonna stick with them till the end.

Beethoven Symphonies in modern Stereo<br />(recorded between 1957 and 1962 - he died in 1964).<br />Scary thought - Today we are further removed from the death of Monteux (52 years) than Monteux was from the death of Beethoven (48 years).<br /><br />Monteux recorded the Nine Symphonies in stereo with three different orchestras for three different labels:<br />-- No. 1,3,6,8 with the Vienna Philharmonic (1957-1960) for Decca<br />-- No. 2,4,5,7 with the London Symphony (1959-1961) for Decca<br />-- No. 9 with the London Symphony (1962) for Westminster<br />-- No. 3 (second recording) with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1962) for Philips<br />(Monteux was 87 years old in 1962)<br />-- plus three Overtures with the London Symphony (1960) for Decca<br /><br />Soloists in the Ninth: Elisabeth S&ouml;derstr&ouml;m, Regina Resnik, Jon Vickers (R.I.P.) and David Ward.<br /><br />In 1998 Universal Music Group bought Decca, Philips and Westminster.<br />Surprisingly, 2015 marks the belated first appearance of Monteux's Beethoven as a boxed set.<br />Worth the wait, and its not very expensive (6 discs for $33)<br />With the exception of the Fidelio Overture, everything has already been released on individual CDs - over the past thirty years.<br /><br />In addition to nine Symphonies (ten recordings) and three Overtures, this box includes a 26 minute rehearsal of the Ninth Symphony (movements 1-3)<br />plus an impromptu performance of &#34;La Marseillaise&#34; in honor of Monteux.<br />It does not include include the 14 minute rehearsal of the Eroica Funeral March with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw - once on a Philips CD.*<br />There wasn't room on the six generously filled CDs.<br /><br />The packaging is slightly annoying -  One of those six CD plastic boxes with the fold-out trays.<br />It slides into a cardboard slipcase (with a different cover photo of Monteux).<br />Sixteen page booklet with detailed notes by Rob Cowan.<br />The recordings were newly remastered by Chris Bernauer in 2015<br />They strike me as an improvement over Decca's remastering of twenty years ago.<br /><br />As conceptions, the 1957 Vienna and 1962 Amsterdam Eroicas are virtually identical.<br />I used to prefer the 1962 Eroica because of the warmer sound, recorded in Amsterdam's Concertgebouw.<br />The 1957 Vienna Eroica also sounded a lot harsher than the Vienna Symphonies 1, 6 and 8, recorded 1958-1960.<br />This despite the fact that all four were produced by John Culshaw and recorded in the Sofiensaal.<br />Stereo sound was new in 1957.<br />The Vienna Philharmonic was closely microphoned to create an exaggerated stereo image.<br />Very little hall ambience - lots of detail, but not much warmth.<br />The violins and first trumpet were especially harsh.<br />Most of this has been remedied in the new remastering - the Eroica still sounds drier than everything else in this box, but I am no longer put off by it.<br /><br />In these recordings, Pierre Monteux seated the orchestra with first violins on the left and second violins on the right.<br />This was the accepted Nineteenth Century practice.<br />Two other Nineteenth Century Conductors, Bruno Walter (1876-1962) and Otto Klemperer (1885-1973) lived long enough to leave us with stereo sets of Beethoven. **<br />They also divided violins left and right (as did Toscanini and Furtwangler - who didn't live long enough for stereo).<br />The modern seating plan - promoted by the most influential conductors of the second half of the Twentieth Century - Bernstein, Karajan and Solti - is to seat all violins on the left, with violas and cellos on the right<br />(divided violins are coming back into fashion, but are still a minority preference).<br /><br />Listen to the finale of the Vienna Eroica over headphones.<br />The stereo effect is exaggerated: first violins on the extreme left, seconds on the extreme right.<br />There is a lot of antiphonal back and forth between the violins.<br />Beethoven expected you to hear this - you will hear it from Monteux, Walter and Klemperer, but you won't hear it from Bernstein, Karajan and Solti.<br />You can also hear divided violins on the 1962 Amsterdam Eroica, but the effect is less exaggerated.<br />After the 1957 Eroica, Decca engineers moved their microphones further back into the hall for greater warmth.<br />You can still hear divided violins, but not as clearly - the sound picture is more blended.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />* Monteux

Bloom is a great album that deserves five stars.  But Depression Cherry is simply Bloom without melody.  If aimless, floating organ and ethereal singing are your thing, then by all means, enjoy this album.  But to give Depression Cherry five stars is to degrade the achievement of Bloom.

It is a once in a lifetime performance, and beautifully recorded in the famed acoustic of Symphony Hall, Boston.  The orchestra is currently on tour  in Europe and I heard them do the Shost 10 in London at the Albert Hall a few days ago, a great  performance, but this live take from Boston is even better.  The recording balances do justice to each section of the orchestra and if you listen,as I do, on high end equipment, you will be impressed  This sad and gloomy work requires a dark chocolaty sound from the lower strings..  In that connection, I think of Wagner's genius in scoring the beginning of Siegfried with low, low strings and winds, to suggest gloom, darkness (and one hell of a big dragon!)  But, if the mike placement  and balancing in the mix isn't sensitive to this, the darkness is not presented properly.  It is in this recording, and the engineers who worked on it should  be proud of themselves.  There are valid  arguments  to be made about other performances, and there are many good ones, but Nelsons who will be the saviour of this beaten up and abandoned orchestra, has a special feeling for the oppression the composer endured.  He is, in a sense to Shostakovich as Lenny was to Mahler, a total identificaction with the composer's psyche.  This recording will not be matched easily.  HIGHLY  recommended.

Despite its lukewarm reviews, 'Above' is considered a classic among fans of Seattle/grunge rock, and the unforgettable single &#34;River of Deceit&#34; is one of Staley's best remembered songs. The group arguably sounded better live, as their style of music, rock/jazz/blues, lent itself to that setting, sounding looser, more powerful live than on record. Twenty years after the release of 'Above' and the Moore show, Mad Season's surviving members, McCready and Martin, have reconvened with Seattle native Duff McKagan (bass, Guns N' Roses, Velvet Revolver, Loaded), and a host of singers, Chris Cornell, Kim Virant, and Jeff Angell, for a one-off concert with the Seattle Symphony. A mostly reunited Temple of the Dog performs two songs.<br /><br />'Sonic Evolution' (2015) was recorded at the S. Mark Taper Foundation Auditorium on January 30, 2015. While it may seem odd to have the band backed by an orchestra, this sort of arrangement is nothing new, i.e., Deep Purple, Metallica, KISS. The album starts off with &#34;Waking the Horizon,&#34; a McCready original, which he performs with the Seattle Symphony. While this composition was not on 'Above,&#34; this haunting, yet rocking neoclassical piece doesn't at all feel out of place and gets the concert off to a great start. Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Audioslave) joins the band for the next trio of songs, &#34;Long Day Gone,&#34; &#34;River of Deceit&#34; and &#34;I Don't Know Anything.&#34; Of the three singers featured, Cornell is the best, most logical choice. There are very few singers that can fill Staley's shoes or who could do these songs justice, and the legendary Cornell is one of them (Mark Lanegan would have been another good pick). Cornell gives great renditions and makes these songs his own. The backing orchestration works very well, and while it competes with the band, it doesn't overpower it. While all three tracks are the centerpiece of the concert, &#34;River of Deceit&#34; is the most memorable, with the classical flourishes blending in seamlessly.<br /><br />The rest of the Mad Season portion is stripped down, with no orchestration. &#34;Wake Up&#34; is sung by Kim Virant (Lazy Susan). I'm not familiar with her work, but she sounds good. She has a smokey, earthy voice and performs the song well. The track ends on a wistful note, as though she were singing to the departed Staley, to &#34;wake up,&#34; knowing that it's too late. Singer Jeff Angell (The Missionary Position, Walking Papers) joins the band for &#34;Lifeless Dead&#34; and &#34;I'm Above.&#34; While in all honesty it would have been preferable to have had Cornell sing these, Angell does a good, albeit perfunctory job.<br /><br />Stone Gossard (guitar), Matt Cameron (drums), and Jeff Ament (bass), all McCready's bandmates in Pearl Jam, join him and Cornell for a Temple of the Dog reunion on &#34;Call Me a Dog&#34; and &#34;Reach Down.&#34; These live renditions sound very good and it's great to see this one-off, early 1990's group reunited, although it's a shame that Eddie Vedder didn't participate. The album's final track &#34;All Alone&#34; which also concluded 'Above,' uses a sampling of Staley, and it sent a chill down my spine when I first heard it. It was great to hear his voice, and it was done in a very tactful way, concluding the concert with one of his most hauntingly beautiful songs.<br /><br />While 'Sonic Evolution' isn't as memorable as the classic 'Moore' show, it is still very, very good. If you are a fan of Mad Season and the 'Above' album, or 1990's Seattle rock in general, this disc is highly recommend. While the Cornell trackswith the Seattle Symphony and the finale &#34;All Alone&#34; are highlights, the entire show is superb and a blu-ray/DVD would be welcome.le &#34;All Alone&#34; are highlights,

I still really haven't gotten over the shock of this being an AOR outing instead of the metal one I was expecting. I remember one of the first The Sword album reviews I ever read on Amazon. It said  &#34;Forget what you expect from skinny jean wearing, wool hat in the heat of Texas, bearded hipster bands from Austin Texas. This isn't one of them&#34; or something to that affect. Well, it's happened. The Sword has turned into a hipster band. Did they tire of metal? Do they have &#34;higher&#34; (sorry) ambitions? I don't understand. Please, I still think this is a well crafted, great sounding album. But I'm an idiot for not letting some others hear it first, read some reviews, and then decide. Oh well. Please guys in The Sword: I'm a bit older than most of the other average modern metal fans, or at least I think I am...and I already lived through this era of stoner AOR (Album Oriented (FM) Radio) and it didn't end well. Come back, let your musical hair grow back out. Put your leathers back on. Grow your facial hair for a few days.  Let your ink show. Make your next album lean more towards Electric Wizard than Bob Seger.

I was thrilled with the overall concept of this album, which focuses on Rachmaninoff’s history of writing variations over a period of about 30 years.<br /><br />Opening the CD is the all too familiar “Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini”.  The Paganini Rhapsody is the only orchestral work on the release, and chances are everyone has their favorite version of this by now; mine was Pletnev on piano with Pesek conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra.  This new version of Trifonov playing along side conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin and the Philadelphia Orchestra absolutely keeps up with the greatest recordings available.  The sound quality is clear, meaty, the players are energized, tempos are not extreme to the point of distraction, and the young Russian pianist accomplishes the difficult task of performing with an appropriate amount of nostalgia and respect without getting bogged down by it.  The orchestra is unwavering in its support for him and they blend harmoniously into each other, never fighting for your attention.<br /><br />This is a remarkable concert all around.  Each variation sounds both distinctive with character and part of the whole.  They flow seamlessly and it never gets messy; it truly sounds like one cohesive piece of music that happens to be comprised of 24 variations of a single theme.  That 18th variation, which can sometimes risk being consumed by its own dreamy nature, here strikes a perfect balance without becoming too self-aware.  One of the best renditions I’ve heard.<br /><br />This partnership definitely benefits from their togetherness, and if you’re considering this CD or digital download on the basis on this work alone then purchase with confidence and you’ll find that it quickly leaps to the top of the heap with your other favorites.  This is a marriage that works, and I canonly hope for further collaborative efforts between these parties.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is solo piano, recorded in New York.  The sound of the piano is noticeably different, not quite as great as the Philadelphia recording, but still retains the same warm, unmuddled, and compassionate sound that I prefer.<br /><br />“Variations on a Theme of Chopin” is an early set of variations which show Rachmaninoff’s talent in the genre, but one that he wouldn’t revisit for many years.  The work is based on the well-known Prelude in C minor (Op. 28, no. 20).  The composer, through Trifonov, is able to turn a relatively somber theme and transform it as needed into gentle, introspective, or anthemic episodes.<br /><br />Trifonov does omit variations 11, 18 and 19 completely and I believe modifies 10 and 12, which is a departure from what Rachmaninoff originally granted in his written instructions (he allowed some concessions to be made).  Also missing, thankfully, is the silly presto that officially ends the piece.  This is removed entirely and in its place is a restatement of the theme, ending strong instead of soft. If you were hoping for the complete and unedited score then I’m sorry to say this not the presentation provided.  For me these are not exactly gripes, and did not detract from my experience.  It is a beautiful piece of music that can sometimes wander, is perhaps a bit overlong, but if you’re unacquainted with it then it deserves your immediate attention.<br /><br />Trifonov also wrote an original piece called “Rachmaniana”, which isn’t exactly a set of variations, but he wears the composer’s heart on his sleeve.  Instead of explaining it away or delving into it, and since the presence of this piece probably doesn’t have any bearing on your decision-making, I’ll let you experience it for yourself.<br /><br />You also have the “Variations on a Theme of Corelli” which are fun and exciting, and contain the same quality and consistentwriting found in the best of Rachmaninoff.  My hope is that this release will reel people in with the familiar and give them a chance to experience more of this side of Rachmaninoff’s gifts as a musical magician, aided by Trifonov’s wonderfully immersing and powerful statements as an interpreter and performer.

I always thought the tone of Jim’s guitar on the Stages release sounded compressed, but with this remastering that is now gone and the tone sounds warmer and much more like it should. Getting deep down into the mix in the proper hands can do wonders and Bernie Grundman did a good job. Also reverb to Jimi’s guitar is what Stages did not have ( don’t know if it was added or originally recorded as).. Red House on Stages is 10:53 and Jimi’s guitar goes way out of tune to the point of it becoming unlistenable. However like I thought would happen , a cut and past edit job was done to omit where Jimi goes way out of tune so this version is scaled down to 8:27 omitting the 2:26 of what you probably don’t want to hear anyway even though the last few minutes dose include Jimi playing his strat out of  tune. Jimi sounds like he's tearing the insides out of his guitar on Hear My Train A Comin’ a torrid , burning, hurricane blast version .. is worth the price alone and Spanish Castle Magic and Foxy Lady are probably my favorite versions.(when you hear Foxy Lady you will not believe your ears!.. yes it's that good ..be prepared,  it will practically make your hairs stand on end  .. If you have the dvd you already know that some of his scorching funkified solo is with his teeth!) Jimi's rhythm guitar and voicing's in between vocals on a great version of Hey Joe  give a small example of  his rhythm  guitar genius is displayed even though you can tell that he's basically just going through the motions to a degree, having played the song hundred's of times and probably tired of playing it by now.. The Star Spangled Banner segue’s and explodes into Straight Ahead,  which has now become a fully formed cohesive song as opposed to the  opening jam on Berkeley 2nd set , recorded just two months earlier .So if you have Stages and like it your going to love this. If you’re a Jimi freak and were never able to get your hands on “Stages” stop what your doing now and order this, you won’t be disappointed.and like it your going to love this.

One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance. The songs are as catchy as ever and Shoot Out All the Lights contains a great call and response section. Motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doesn't change with the infectious Til The End. Every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale, a cover of the Rolling Stones' &#34;Sympathy for the Devil.&#34; Not very many bands could pull off a Stones cover, but HOLY CRAP does Motorhead SLAY this song! I was smiling from ear to ear. Lemmy doesn't try to mimic Jagger but instead puts his own unique snarling spin on the vocals while Phil plays a couple of perfect solos to compliment Dee's tight and fluid drumming. This album is pretty much perfect and this band needs a #1 in the U.S. so I urge you, if you want some talented classic metal in your life, pick this album up.

This album is crap, garbage, unlistenable (and I've listend to it twice and for the last time). Valentine must think he is the new Phil Spector only Valentine's production is a &#34;wall of noise&#34; not a &#34;wall of sound.&#34; What's with all of the gratuitous and excessive slaps, stomps, drum programming, catter-walling background vocals - even the keyboard and guitar parts are used for &#34;percussive&#34; effect rather than melody. Grace has a powerful and wonderful voice but it is wasted here and often seems mixed too far in the background. The songwriting is terrible. The overproduction makes almost very song sound the same. Some reviewers think this has a disco feel. I hated disco - but this is even worse. Some compare it to Britney Spears - this album makes Britney Spears and the Spice Girls sound talented. Grace - lose Valentine ASAP and get your head straight again. This ranks among the worst five albums in my over 2000 album collection and one of the worst I have ever listened to in the last 50 years!

The compilation contains only the six A-sides and six cover tunes, and none of the reworkings.  Also included is a bonus live track and a bonus demo dating back to sometime in the 90s.<br /><br />The new songs are all in Marshall's later mode: mid-tempo, sometimes downbeat, often with a wryly reflective point of view.  As well, the well-scrubbed pop hooks of thirty years ago are now much more subtle, and may take a few spins to sink in.  Unfortunately, the album isn't well served by putting all six of these originals back-to-back to lead off the album, as the tone of each of these six songs is somewhat similar, and it makes the album seem more monochromatic than it actually is.<br /><br />The seven covers (including the live bonus track) are a little more stylistically diverse, ranging from some rock-oriented Everly Brothers material to an achingly sincere &#34;Close To You&#34;.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing absolutely revelatory about #392, but the album is still chock full of good songcraft performed with skill and passion.  If you're a long-term Crenshaw fan, this is a worthwhile purchase.  But if you're just getting in to Mr. Crenshaw's work?  I would say that there are other albums (Downtown, Life's Too Short, Marshall Crenshaw) that show him to greater advantage -- explore those ones first.

The music on this dual CD was recorded on 22 January 1975 at Shinjuku Kohseinenkin Hall in Tokyo, 10 days before the Agharta/Pangaea concerts in Osaka on 1st February. The Tokyo performance was originally recorded as an FM radio broadcast to be aired only in Japan, and includes different material to the Osaka concerts.<br /><br />The band has the same line-up as Agharta/Pangea: Miles; two electric guitarists, Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas; percussionist James Mtume Heath; young bass player Michael Henderson (who Miles stole from Stevie Wonder’s backing band!); Sonny Fortune on sax & flute, and drummer Al Foster.<br /><br />If you like Agharta/Pangea, you’re going to like this: the band is in the same raunchy jazz/funk groove. Much of the performance is dominated by high-energy interplay between Cosey and Lucas, and Miles’ contributions to the sound are often played through a wah-wah pedal. Throughout Miles’ electric-fusion period 1969-75 no two performances were the same but each had structure, guided by Miles as band director as the music unfolds. As on Agharta/Pangea it’s obvious that this band knows its business, but no-one knew in advance when the changes would happen or where the music would go.<br /><br />In a 2015 essay on Miles’ fusion/funk period, Angus Batey writes that the listener can best appreciate this music if s/he has “the ability to grasp the plan and understand the context for, and the nature of, these still shockingly futuristic and unequalled sounds…Miles and his 1975 band fusing jazz, rock and funk into a seamless, satisfying and richly rewarding whole”.<br /><br />If you don’t know the Agharta/Pangea concerts but you do know ‘A Tribute to Jack Johnson’ and especially ‘Dark Magus’, you’re in essentially the same territory here. This is the raunchiest and funkiest territory in the vast continent of Miles Davis’ unequalled musical legacy. It’s regrettable that no-one is taking risks in exploring unknown musical landscapes like this in the 21st century.of Miles Davis’ unequalled musical legacy.

I was really disappointed when the release got pushed out to the end of August, but I wanted my own copy of Shut Up and Fish so much I waited it out. Not at all disappointed that I did, I really like the whole album. Was playing it with my sister in the car and commented that they reminded my a lot of the Dixie Chicks and she said&#34; I thought that is who it was!&#34; Having never heard the song before, she was singing along to the chorus of Shut Up before the it was over. Stay on Your Side of Town is in the vein of Sin Wagon, one of my all time favorite DC songs and I smile every time I listen to it again.<br /><br />Of course, the radio hits are there too, like &#34;Girl in a Country Song&#34; and &#34;Fly&#34;, but really, every song on this album could be a hit. The lyrics are clever and memorable. The harmony is great, the songs have real melodies and genuine country feel with fiddle, banjo and (I believe) steel guitar making contributions, and there are some pretty good regular guitar parts too.<br /><br />I never feel like these girls are screaming at me, a common problem with many of the &#34;big&#34; female country stars in my opinion. Another reviewer pegged the target audience as kids to 20's, but I'm in my 50's and my wife and sister in their 60's and we all liked it.

I found out about her today from browsing new music and just after hearing a few songs, I'm hooked. She gives me Amy Winehouse/Adele/old soul/jazz vibes and I love it. I have found a new artist that instantly deserves praise for their debut album. This will be on repeat for me.

As you can imagine - guitar-heroes who were 'Irish' could be typed on a very small piece of paper indeed. But man oh man when we stumped up our candidate for selection – Ireland produced a proper goodun.<br /><br />So what of this much-anticipated reissue? As much as I worship the ground Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster walked on – this 2015 Universal 4CD Reissue is both good and awful in very equal measures. The good news is that the PASCHAL BYRNE remasters of the two studio albums are off-the-wall good. Byrne has a long and distinguished history as an Audio Engineer having handled the &#34;Spirit Of Joy&#34; Polydor 3CD Box Set and hundreds of other quality reissues for Universal and Esoteric Recordings over the last decade. But I'm sensing awards are in order because the boy has excelled himself here. The audio on the two albums is fabulous – the best I've ever heard - and I've known and loved these LPs for over 45 years. The Previously Unreleased outtakes from those studio efforts are also genuinely worth having too – stuff that will make blind men see, preachers lay their Bibles down and even persuade politicians to go straight (well lets not ask for too much shall we).<br /><br />But (all puns aside) Discs 3 and 4 are a different matter. The very well-recorded Swedish gig is electrifying (it really is) but the 'Off Air' &#34;BBC Live In Concert&#34; stuff that finishes off Disc 3 is virtually unlistenable – poor bootleg standard at best. And the fact that an exclusive song like &#34;Feel So Good&#34; on the officially released &#34;Live Taste&#34; and &#34;Live At The Isle Of Wight&#34; LPs from 1971 and 1972 has been replaced with this lesser stuff will only rub salt into the wounds for fans. Disc 4 is not much better - the 'Belfast Sessions' are Demos notoriously inflicted with tape dropouts on almost all tracks that 'has not' been fixed - so they're curio value at best rather than a pleasurable listen. In fairness to the makers of the box – this stuff is included of course for completeness and some of the earlier tracks are actually worth listening to. But if they're audibly damaged – then why include them at all. The Major Minor single is crap and the Woburn stuff good rather than great (a very so-so recording). In truth - had this been a 3CD set containing the Swedish gig and the stragglers not duplicated from the official live albums slapped on at the end of Disc 3 – then it would have been perfect. As it is – I know I'll only be playing those first two discs and the live Swedish gig off the 3rd – and ditching the inferior rest.

Produced by Donal and Daniel Gallagher (his family) alongside Joe Black – the superbly detailed sleeve notes are by NIGEL WILLIAMSON and go into Rory’s early days in Belfast at The Maritime Club (Taste took over residency from Van Morrison's Them) on to their first reference on a London billboard (August 1967 as a support act to Robert Hirst at The Marquee) and even meeting John Peel in a transport caf&eacute; (he remained a huge fan of Gallagher for years). Pages 28 to 29 are festooned with photographs I’ve never seen before of the young band in Cork, on their way to a date Scotland, tours with Traffic, sharing the Bill with Roger Chapman’s Family at the Camden Roundhouse and so on. There’s even a very old newspaper clipping of a happy Rory amidst a bunch of Cork hopefuls on a 'Spot The Talent' show smiling beneath a Mrs. Mary Carey-O'Mahony who had to be 75 if not a day! It's properly great stuff and affectionate too...the only error I can see is that a Danish titled picture sleeve of &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; is credited as a UK release when it never had a picture sleeve in this country.<br /><br />SINGLES:<br />Eagle-eyed fans will know that the first Taste 45 was &#34;Blister On The Moon&#34; b/w &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; on Major Minor Records MM 560 in April 1968 (long before they had an album) – and both cuts were different mixes to the re-recorded versions that turned up on the debut LP in 1969. Although it doesn’t state it directly on the packaging (it is mentioned in the excellent booklet) - they are here on Disc 4, Tracks 8 and 9 as part of ‘The Belfast Sessions’. That whole recording was issued in the UK as a Rory Gallagher LP called &#34;In The Beginning&#34; on Emerald Records GES 1100 in 1974 (it was later subject to successful prosecution). The only officially released British Polydor single came when the label put out the newly recorded LP cut of &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; b/w &#34;Same Old Story&#34; as a first 7&#34; single on Polydor 56313 in March 1969. But in that strange way that Polydor didn't support the first Stone The Crows LP with a 45 when they should have done – Polydor didn't bother to plug the 2nd Taste LP &#34;On The Boards&#34; with a single either although &#34;What's Going On&#34; was an obvious choice. In fact that track flipped with &#34;Railway And Gun&#34; and &#34;If I Don't Sing, I'll Cry&#34; b/w &#34;I'll Remember&#34; were both released as 7&#34; singles in many European countries (a set of those picture sleeves adorns the last page of the attached booklet).<br /><br />STUDIO LPS:<br />Produced by Tony Colton - the debut LP opens with a belter - &#34;Blister On The Moon&#34; - and immediately I'm hit with the quality remaster – the bass and drums so clear. We now get the first of the album's four cover versions – Huddie &#34;Leadbelly&#34; Ledbetter's &#34;Leavin' Blues&#34; which sounds incredible – that strangely sparse slide sound he’s getting. The other three covers are a grungy (and hissy) &#34;Sugar Mama&#34; by Howlin' Wolf, his amazing cut of Robert Petway's 1941 Bluebird Records stalwart &#34;Catfish&#34; and a Countrified shuffle through Hank Snow's &#34;I'm Moving On” (the rest are Gallagher compositions). His acoustic-only &#34;Hail&#34; sounds incredible while it's easy to hear why the re-recording of &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; was an obvious single. “Dual Carriageway Pain” was badly recorded in my opinion and still sounds strangely tame - as if the song just needed to let rip somehow to infuse it with some genuine excitement. The same unfortunately applies to &#34;Same Old Story&#34; – a good tune hampered by a weedy recording. But then we get a true monster and surely why Hendrix was so impressed by Gallagher - his cover of &#34;Catfish&#34;. Hendrix recorded &#34;Catfish&#34; himself in a similar 8-minute Bluesy vein (It was finally released as &#34;Catfish Blues&#34; on the superb &#34;Blues&#34; CD from 1994). It's as if Gallagher knew that something needed to be done – so he cranks the amps up to 90 and does an 8-minute Blues Rock thrashing of &#34;Catfish&#34;. With heavy riffs like he's auditioning for Led Zeppelin - you can hear the amps rumbling in the background – his playing inspired because the structure of the song allows him to let go. It's a standout on an otherwise strangely tame debut LP...<br /><br />The 2nd album &#34;On The Boards&#34; is an entirely different beast to the first – so much more sophisticated and filled with far better songs (all Rory originals). Again produced by Tony Colton but Engineered by Eddie Offord (late of Yes fame) – the audio is brilliant and the remaster absolutely brings that to life. &#34;What's Going On&#34; has always made me throw undignified shapes around my living room with a tennis racket (still does) – but little prepared me for the stunning audio on Bluesy &#34;Railway And Gun&#34; and the jazzy &#34;It's Happened Before, It'll Happen Again&#34; (Rory gives the Alto Saxophone a rare outing on this one). The Fleetwood Mac &#34;Then Play On&#34; boogie of &#34;Morning Sun&#34; is wicked too. The Johnny Winter style cool slide of &#34;Eat My Words&#34; sounds awesome, as does Rory's clever Harmonica inclusion on &#34;If The Day Was Any Longer&#34; (again with gorgeous Audio).<br /><br />LIVE STUFF:<br />A six-minute &#34;What's Going On&#34; allows Rory to stretch out and get the crowd going but it’s the fabulous Blues Rock riffage of &#34;Sugar Mama&#34; that gets them clapping and screaming. He does a wicked electric slide version of Melvin Jackson's &#34;Gamblin' Blues&#34; where he sounds like Mike Bloomfield enjoying himself even though &#34;...my woman eat me out of house and home...&#34; We then get a track that would eventually turn up in studio form on his 1971 debut solo LP – &#34;Sinner Boy&#34;. He slows it down with a 'new one' called &#34;At The Bottom&#34; which features his Harmonica playing (he would eventually record it for 1975's &#34;Against The Grain&#34;). Next up is a very cool version of Muddy Waters' &#34;She's Nineteen Years Old&#34; which has the crowd clapping to its salacious Blues beat – a great inclusion. It's followed by a forgotten nugget from &#34;On The Boards&#34; – a huge rocking version of &#34;Morning Sun&#34; fully brought to life in the live environment where Taste suddenly sound like a four-piece band and not just a trio. And it ends on the crowd-pleaser Blues-Rock of &#34;Catfish&#34; sounding every bit as powerful as the debut LP version – hair-raising note bending and all that. This is Heavy Hard Rock and I love it...<br /><br />After the high of the Swedish recording – the BBC tracks come as a truly dreadful disappointment – they’re no better than a bad bootleg recording and even though &#34;Eat My Words&#34; is electrifying in all its slide-guitar glory – the audio makes it virtually unlistenable. Disc 4 offers some solace in 1967 demos of Big Joe Turner's &#34;Wee Wee Baby&#34;, Howlin' Wolf's &#34;How Many More Years&#34; and a wicked Bluesy version of Sonny Boy Williamson's &#34;Take It Easy Baby&#34; which stretches to 7:13 minutes. The bad news is that those three-or-four-second tape drop-outs on &#34;How Many More Years&#34;, &#34;Pardon Me Mister&#34;, &#34;You've Got To Pay&#34;, &#34;Norman Invasion&#34; (a three-minute instrumental) and &#34;Worried Man&#34; are still there making the listen a curio rather than a genuine pleasure. The Major Minor single versions of &#34;Blister On The Moon&#34; and &#34;Born On The Wrong Side Of Time&#34; in Mono sound strictly amateur-hour compared to their 1969 Polydor re-recordings and the Woburn Abbey gig is good rather than great. All in all – there's too much of Disc 3 and 4 that's dismissible. So there you have it – a very mixed bag - but I have to say that I’m lapping up the remasters of the studio albums and their alternate versions.<br /><br />Once asked what’s it like to be seen as the greatest guitar player in the world – Jimi Hendrix reputedly replied, &#34;I don't know. You should ask Rory Gallagher...&#34; And at least parts of this &#34;I'll Remember&#34; 4CD release hammer home why the mighty Jimi was such an admirer...let) - they are here on Disc 4, Tracks 8 and 9 as part of ‘The Belfast Sessions’.

Well, I chose to take a chunk of time out of my busy day and do just that because I feel like I need to let as many people as possible know about this truly amazing music collection.  I suffer with deep recurring depression. So I did what every trusting, good patient does and filled my script for the antidepressant prozac and it gave me these really bad headaches in the back of my head. I &#34;googled&#34; it and apparently, that's a pretty  commons side-effect.  I started with just playing it one disc after another in order and the music was really good.  Normally, I like classic rock and metal, but this stuff sort of spoke to me.  I know that sounds cray-cray but it's true.  One night I couldn't sleep (another wonderful side-effect of the medication) had that headache again too. well, I fell right to sleep never even made it through the first disc!  I woke up feeling pretty good too.  So I decided to try something (and I'm sorry this is so long but I want to be honest with you). I stopped taking my meds and decided to see if this healing stuff was for real.  That was 2 weeks ago and I haven't taken another pill since.  Headaches are gone. I feel good and I'm now convinced that this music and Michael S. Tyrell are the real deal.  It comes with a really goo dbook written by Michael too. It explains how this project came to be and how God Himself inspires Michael to help people every day.  But you don't have to be religious to dig this stuff. It works for people no matter what their background is.  Give it a try, the worst that could happen is that you’ll get your money back if you don’t like it! But I bet it makes you feel great like it did me.

From the very beginning, they’ve succeeded in making rawness and ugliness sound appealing. So even as Lemmy’s voice has grown wheezier over the past few years, it matters not; as long as it fits the band’s gritty sound, they can work this imperfection in their favour. But that’s not to say that his singing isn’t good on this album. The man can still hit the high notes when needed; the unexpected key change at the end of “Shoot Out All of Your Lights” extinguishes all doubt in that area.<br /><br />The snarl and attitude is still 100% present in the vocals as well, which is made immediately apparent with the first track “Victory or Die” – a truly blistering opening statement which aims to convince each and every listener that Motörhead have no intentions of toning it down in spite of their age. “Thunder and Lightning” follows, and steps things up a notch with a faster tempo, a greater intensity, and more memorable moments. It’s at this stage where listeners can stop worrying about whether or not this great band can still deliver, and instead just sit back and enjoy the rest of the album with confidence that they’re in for quite a ride.<br /><br />Next comes “Fire Storm Hotel”, providing some welcome variation with its groovy ZZ Top-type groove and super catchy vocal melody. The riff is actually kinda like a variation of Top’s “Sharp Dressed Man”, in a similar way to how “No Class” bears resemblance to “Tush”, though perhaps not quite as closely.<br /><br />“Shoot Out All of Your Lights” follows, and pretty much eclipses everything the album has offered up until this point, and unfortunately casts a shadow over the three lesser tracks that succeed it. “The Devil” and “Evil Eye” turn out to be quite unmemorable by comparison, and “Electricity” basically is just “Smiling Like a Killer” reincarnate, so it automatically loses points for self-plagiarism. On reflection, however, as standalone tracks they’re all quite good. “The Devil” packs a decent punch and has a truly blazing solo from Queen’s Brian May; “Electricity” is still a damn fun rock n’ roll song; and “Evil Eye” has a pumping rhythm, a memorable vocal melody, and an awesome low, growly vocal delivery from Lemmy.<br /><br />All the shortcomings that those few tracks may have had are quickly forgotten as the next track, “Teach Them How to Bleed”, thunders in and gets this album well-and-truly back on track. It’s a fast-paced, relentless steamroller of a song accompanied by some intelligent lyrics. I can’t tell you what most of them mean, but they’re well-worded and full of cynicism and swagger: “Give the people what they want / Blood and death and guts / People so predictable / Drive you f*cking nuts”. What kicks the song further into action, though, is the truly climactic layered solo from Phil Campbell. It comes in half-way through, spends 40 seconds kicking arse, and then leaves the remainder of the song sounding stronger and more vital as a result.<br /><br />And, on that note, it should be said that Phil really is the hero on this album. There isn’t a bad solo on this LP, and on more than one occasion it’s his fiery fretwork that lifts a song out of its potential mediocrity, and transforms everything else from good songs into fantastic songs. This man’s fingers have not aged since the day he joined this band, and the mind that controls them has only grown more inventive and musically articulate. To borrow some adjectives from “In the Year of the Wolf”, his playing is mean and vicious, fast and clever. Album after album, he never fails to impress.<br /><br />“Teach Them How to Bleed” is followed up by the truly grand “Till the End” – a slow-paced, ballad-y reflection on the life from Lemmy’s perspective. It’s a meaningful, cynical, honest, sober song with a tone that is sombre without being defeatist, and personal without being pompous. It’s beautiful, really, and earns a place amongst Motörhead’s classics.<br /><br />After this is “Tell Me Who to Kill”, which underwhelms a little, but features some cool bass lines, and a guitar solo that resembles and rivals that of Brian May’s on “The Devil”. This song is, however, the last of the album’s few low points, as the final three tracks produce nothing but brilliance. “Choking on Your Screams” is delightfully fearsome and dark, both lyrically and musically. “When the Sky Come Looking for You” then comes in with a much more upbeat sound and elevates things to yet another level. The lyrics paint an awesome picture, the chorus sticks with you instantly after one listen, the performance of Mikkey Dee demonstrates exactly why he’s considered one of the best drummers in the business, and the band just seem to have an amazing overall chemistry with each other. The production should not go without mention either. Speaking of chemistry, Cameron Webb just seems to know this band so well now, bringing the best out of their sound time and time again.<br /><br />“When the Sky Come Looking for You” is another song that could easily find a place on Motörhead’s ever-growing list of classics. My only gripe with it is that it could do with a better end. It seems to be a bit of a running theme on this album, where the songs just end so abruptly. One should never underestimate the power of a good ending - something that shows a bit of imagination. They’ve done it in the past. One which comes to mind is the slow, monstrous-sounding crush of the final chords in “The Thousand Names of God” (which always pissed me off when performed live, because they never seemed to nail that ending!) from 2008’s 'Motörizer'. Another is “Trigger” from 2006’s ‘Kiss of Death’, which finishes with a bluesy lick, a pause, and then a quick reprise of one of the song’s main riffs. I would’ve loved to have heard more of this sort of thing on ‘Bad Magic’.<br /><br />Luckily the ending of final track is immensely satisfying. I wasn’t sure if it was such a good idea to cap off the album with a cover, but Motörhead take “Sympathy for the Devil” and give it so much life, vigour, power, and personal flair that it becomes a perfect closer to ‘Bad Magic’. It’s such a joyous, stylish rendition of a song that many rock fans hold close to their hearts. The band sounds like they’re having a world of fun playing it, and the outro sounds truly celebratory. It’s a great end to a great album, and if it is to be their last, then it’ll be a great end to a great career. That’s a notion that I hate to ponder, though. I want this band to keep going forever. I foolishly want the immortality myths to be true. This band has been such a constant in the lives of so many, and a reliable source of timeless, stimulating music. This album proves that we can trust this band to deliver, even in adverse circumstances. Motörhead has earned their loyal following in the fairest way possible, and we’re damn well gonna stick with them till the end.

Beethoven Symphonies in modern Stereo<br />(recorded between 1957 and 1962 - he died in 1964).<br />Scary thought - Today we are further removed from the death of Monteux (52 years) than Monteux was from the death of Beethoven (48 years).<br /><br />Monteux recorded the Nine Symphonies in stereo with three different orchestras for three different labels:<br />-- No. 1,3,6,8 with the Vienna Philharmonic (1957-1960) for Decca<br />-- No. 2,4,5,7 with the London Symphony (1959-1961) for Decca<br />-- No. 9 with the London Symphony (1962) for Westminster<br />-- No. 3 (second recording) with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1962) for Philips<br />(Monteux was 87 years old in 1962)<br />-- plus three Overtures with the London Symphony (1960) for Decca<br /><br />Soloists in the Ninth: Elisabeth S&ouml;derstr&ouml;m, Regina Resnik, Jon Vickers (R.I.P.) and David Ward.<br /><br />In 1998 Universal Music Group bought Decca, Philips and Westminster.<br />Surprisingly, 2015 marks the belated first appearance of Monteux's Beethoven as a boxed set.<br />Worth the wait, and its not very expensive (6 discs for $33)<br />With the exception of the Fidelio Overture, everything has already been released on individual CDs - over the past thirty years.<br /><br />In addition to nine Symphonies (ten recordings) and three Overtures, this box includes a 26 minute rehearsal of the Ninth Symphony (movements 1-3)<br />plus an impromptu performance of &#34;La Marseillaise&#34; in honor of Monteux.<br />It does not include include the 14 minute rehearsal of the Eroica Funeral March with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw - once on a Philips CD.*<br />There wasn't room on the six generously filled CDs.<br /><br />The packaging is slightly annoying -  One of those six CD plastic boxes with the fold-out trays.<br />It slides into a cardboard slipcase (with a different cover photo of Monteux).<br />Sixteen page booklet with detailed notes by Rob Cowan.<br />The recordings were newly remastered by Chris Bernauer in 2015<br />They strike me as an improvement over Decca's remastering of twenty years ago.<br /><br />As conceptions, the 1957 Vienna and 1962 Amsterdam Eroicas are virtually identical.<br />I used to prefer the 1962 Eroica because of the warmer sound, recorded in Amsterdam's Concertgebouw.<br />The 1957 Vienna Eroica also sounded a lot harsher than the Vienna Symphonies 1, 6 and 8, recorded 1958-1960.<br />This despite the fact that all four were produced by John Culshaw and recorded in the Sofiensaal.<br />Stereo sound was new in 1957.<br />The Vienna Philharmonic was closely microphoned to create an exaggerated stereo image.<br />Very little hall ambience - lots of detail, but not much warmth.<br />The violins and first trumpet were especially harsh.<br />Most of this has been remedied in the new remastering - the Eroica still sounds drier than everything else in this box, but I am no longer put off by it.<br /><br />In these recordings, Pierre Monteux seated the orchestra with first violins on the left and second violins on the right.<br />This was the accepted Nineteenth Century practice.<br />Two other Nineteenth Century Conductors, Bruno Walter (1876-1962) and Otto Klemperer (1885-1973) lived long enough to leave us with stereo sets of Beethoven. **<br />They also divided violins left and right (as did Toscanini and Furtwangler - who didn't live long enough for stereo).<br />The modern seating plan - promoted by the most influential conductors of the second half of the Twentieth Century - Bernstein, Karajan and Solti - is to seat all violins on the left, with violas and cellos on the right<br />(divided violins are coming back into fashion, but are still a minority preference).<br /><br />Listen to the finale of the Vienna Eroica over headphones.<br />The stereo effect is exaggerated: first violins on the extreme left, seconds on the extreme right.<br />There is a lot of antiphonal back and forth between the violins.<br />Beethoven expected you to hear this - you will hear it from Monteux, Walter and Klemperer, but you won't hear it from Bernstein, Karajan and Solti.<br />You can also hear divided violins on the 1962 Amsterdam Eroica, but the effect is less exaggerated.<br />After the 1957 Eroica, Decca engineers moved their microphones further back into the hall for greater warmth.<br />You can still hear divided violins, but not as clearly - the sound picture is more blended.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />* Monteux

Bloom is a great album that deserves five stars.  But Depression Cherry is simply Bloom without melody.  If aimless, floating organ and ethereal singing are your thing, then by all means, enjoy this album.  But to give Depression Cherry five stars is to degrade the achievement of Bloom.

It is a once in a lifetime performance, and beautifully recorded in the famed acoustic of Symphony Hall, Boston.  The orchestra is currently on tour  in Europe and I heard them do the Shost 10 in London at the Albert Hall a few days ago, a great  performance, but this live take from Boston is even better.  The recording balances do justice to each section of the orchestra and if you listen,as I do, on high end equipment, you will be impressed  This sad and gloomy work requires a dark chocolaty sound from the lower strings..  In that connection, I think of Wagner's genius in scoring the beginning of Siegfried with low, low strings and winds, to suggest gloom, darkness (and one hell of a big dragon!)  But, if the mike placement  and balancing in the mix isn't sensitive to this, the darkness is not presented properly.  It is in this recording, and the engineers who worked on it should  be proud of themselves.  There are valid  arguments  to be made about other performances, and there are many good ones, but Nelsons who will be the saviour of this beaten up and abandoned orchestra, has a special feeling for the oppression the composer endured.  He is, in a sense to Shostakovich as Lenny was to Mahler, a total identificaction with the composer's psyche.  This recording will not be matched easily.  HIGHLY  recommended.

Despite its lukewarm reviews, 'Above' is considered a classic among fans of Seattle/grunge rock, and the unforgettable single &#34;River of Deceit&#34; is one of Staley's best remembered songs. The group arguably sounded better live, as their style of music, rock/jazz/blues, lent itself to that setting, sounding looser, more powerful live than on record. Twenty years after the release of 'Above' and the Moore show, Mad Season's surviving members, McCready and Martin, have reconvened with Seattle native Duff McKagan (bass, Guns N' Roses, Velvet Revolver, Loaded), and a host of singers, Chris Cornell, Kim Virant, and Jeff Angell, for a one-off concert with the Seattle Symphony. A mostly reunited Temple of the Dog performs two songs.<br /><br />'Sonic Evolution' (2015) was recorded at the S. Mark Taper Foundation Auditorium on January 30, 2015. While it may seem odd to have the band backed by an orchestra, this sort of arrangement is nothing new, i.e., Deep Purple, Metallica, KISS. The album starts off with &#34;Waking the Horizon,&#34; a McCready original, which he performs with the Seattle Symphony. While this composition was not on 'Above,&#34; this haunting, yet rocking neoclassical piece doesn't at all feel out of place and gets the concert off to a great start. Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Audioslave) joins the band for the next trio of songs, &#34;Long Day Gone,&#34; &#34;River of Deceit&#34; and &#34;I Don't Know Anything.&#34; Of the three singers featured, Cornell is the best, most logical choice. There are very few singers that can fill Staley's shoes or who could do these songs justice, and the legendary Cornell is one of them (Mark Lanegan would have been another good pick). Cornell gives great renditions and makes these songs his own. The backing orchestration works very well, and while it competes with the band, it doesn't overpower it. While all three tracks are the centerpiece of the concert, &#34;River of Deceit&#34; is the most memorable, with the classical flourishes blending in seamlessly.<br /><br />The rest of the Mad Season portion is stripped down, with no orchestration. &#34;Wake Up&#34; is sung by Kim Virant (Lazy Susan). I'm not familiar with her work, but she sounds good. She has a smokey, earthy voice and performs the song well. The track ends on a wistful note, as though she were singing to the departed Staley, to &#34;wake up,&#34; knowing that it's too late. Singer Jeff Angell (The Missionary Position, Walking Papers) joins the band for &#34;Lifeless Dead&#34; and &#34;I'm Above.&#34; While in all honesty it would have been preferable to have had Cornell sing these, Angell does a good, albeit perfunctory job.<br /><br />Stone Gossard (guitar), Matt Cameron (drums), and Jeff Ament (bass), all McCready's bandmates in Pearl Jam, join him and Cornell for a Temple of the Dog reunion on &#34;Call Me a Dog&#34; and &#34;Reach Down.&#34; These live renditions sound very good and it's great to see this one-off, early 1990's group reunited, although it's a shame that Eddie Vedder didn't participate. The album's final track &#34;All Alone&#34; which also concluded 'Above,' uses a sampling of Staley, and it sent a chill down my spine when I first heard it. It was great to hear his voice, and it was done in a very tactful way, concluding the concert with one of his most hauntingly beautiful songs.<br /><br />While 'Sonic Evolution' isn't as memorable as the classic 'Moore' show, it is still very, very good. If you are a fan of Mad Season and the 'Above' album, or 1990's Seattle rock in general, this disc is highly recommend. While the Cornell trackswith the Seattle Symphony and the finale &#34;All Alone&#34; are highlights, the entire show is superb and a blu-ray/DVD would be welcome.le &#34;All Alone&#34; are highlights,

I still really haven't gotten over the shock of this being an AOR outing instead of the metal one I was expecting. I remember one of the first The Sword album reviews I ever read on Amazon. It said  &#34;Forget what you expect from skinny jean wearing, wool hat in the heat of Texas, bearded hipster bands from Austin Texas. This isn't one of them&#34; or something to that affect. Well, it's happened. The Sword has turned into a hipster band. Did they tire of metal? Do they have &#34;higher&#34; (sorry) ambitions? I don't understand. Please, I still think this is a well crafted, great sounding album. But I'm an idiot for not letting some others hear it first, read some reviews, and then decide. Oh well. Please guys in The Sword: I'm a bit older than most of the other average modern metal fans, or at least I think I am...and I already lived through this era of stoner AOR (Album Oriented (FM) Radio) and it didn't end well. Come back, let your musical hair grow back out. Put your leathers back on. Grow your facial hair for a few days.  Let your ink show. Make your next album lean more towards Electric Wizard than Bob Seger.

I was thrilled with the overall concept of this album, which focuses on Rachmaninoff’s history of writing variations over a period of about 30 years.<br /><br />Opening the CD is the all too familiar “Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini”.  The Paganini Rhapsody is the only orchestral work on the release, and chances are everyone has their favorite version of this by now; mine was Pletnev on piano with Pesek conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra.  This new version of Trifonov playing along side conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin and the Philadelphia Orchestra absolutely keeps up with the greatest recordings available.  The sound quality is clear, meaty, the players are energized, tempos are not extreme to the point of distraction, and the young Russian pianist accomplishes the difficult task of performing with an appropriate amount of nostalgia and respect without getting bogged down by it.  The orchestra is unwavering in its support for him and they blend harmoniously into each other, never fighting for your attention.<br /><br />This is a remarkable concert all around.  Each variation sounds both distinctive with character and part of the whole.  They flow seamlessly and it never gets messy; it truly sounds like one cohesive piece of music that happens to be comprised of 24 variations of a single theme.  That 18th variation, which can sometimes risk being consumed by its own dreamy nature, here strikes a perfect balance without becoming too self-aware.  One of the best renditions I’ve heard.<br /><br />This partnership definitely benefits from their togetherness, and if you’re considering this CD or digital download on the basis on this work alone then purchase with confidence and you’ll find that it quickly leaps to the top of the heap with your other favorites.  This is a marriage that works, and I canonly hope for further collaborative efforts between these parties.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is solo piano, recorded in New York.  The sound of the piano is noticeably different, not quite as great as the Philadelphia recording, but still retains the same warm, unmuddled, and compassionate sound that I prefer.<br /><br />“Variations on a Theme of Chopin” is an early set of variations which show Rachmaninoff’s talent in the genre, but one that he wouldn’t revisit for many years.  The work is based on the well-known Prelude in C minor (Op. 28, no. 20).  The composer, through Trifonov, is able to turn a relatively somber theme and transform it as needed into gentle, introspective, or anthemic episodes.<br /><br />Trifonov does omit variations 11, 18 and 19 completely and I believe modifies 10 and 12, which is a departure from what Rachmaninoff originally granted in his written instructions (he allowed some concessions to be made).  Also missing, thankfully, is the silly presto that officially ends the piece.  This is removed entirely and in its place is a restatement of the theme, ending strong instead of soft. If you were hoping for the complete and unedited score then I’m sorry to say this not the presentation provided.  For me these are not exactly gripes, and did not detract from my experience.  It is a beautiful piece of music that can sometimes wander, is perhaps a bit overlong, but if you’re unacquainted with it then it deserves your immediate attention.<br /><br />Trifonov also wrote an original piece called “Rachmaniana”, which isn’t exactly a set of variations, but he wears the composer’s heart on his sleeve.  Instead of explaining it away or delving into it, and since the presence of this piece probably doesn’t have any bearing on your decision-making, I’ll let you experience it for yourself.<br /><br />You also have the “Variations on a Theme of Corelli” which are fun and exciting, and contain the same quality and consistentwriting found in the best of Rachmaninoff.  My hope is that this release will reel people in with the familiar and give them a chance to experience more of this side of Rachmaninoff’s gifts as a musical magician, aided by Trifonov’s wonderfully immersing and powerful statements as an interpreter and performer.

I always thought the tone of Jim’s guitar on the Stages release sounded compressed, but with this remastering that is now gone and the tone sounds warmer and much more like it should. Getting deep down into the mix in the proper hands can do wonders and Bernie Grundman did a good job. Also reverb to Jimi’s guitar is what Stages did not have ( don’t know if it was added or originally recorded as).. Red House on Stages is 10:53 and Jimi’s guitar goes way out of tune to the point of it becoming unlistenable. However like I thought would happen , a cut and past edit job was done to omit where Jimi goes way out of tune so this version is scaled down to 8:27 omitting the 2:26 of what you probably don’t want to hear anyway even though the last few minutes dose include Jimi playing his strat out of  tune. Jimi sounds like he's tearing the insides out of his guitar on Hear My Train A Comin’ a torrid , burning, hurricane blast version .. is worth the price alone and Spanish Castle Magic and Foxy Lady are probably my favorite versions.(when you hear Foxy Lady you will not believe your ears!.. yes it's that good ..be prepared,  it will practically make your hairs stand on end  .. If you have the dvd you already know that some of his scorching funkified solo is with his teeth!) Jimi's rhythm guitar and voicing's in between vocals on a great version of Hey Joe  give a small example of  his rhythm  guitar genius is displayed even though you can tell that he's basically just going through the motions to a degree, having played the song hundred's of times and probably tired of playing it by now.. The Star Spangled Banner segue’s and explodes into Straight Ahead,  which has now become a fully formed cohesive song as opposed to the  opening jam on Berkeley 2nd set , recorded just two months earlier .So if you have Stages and like it your going to love this. If you’re a Jimi freak and were never able to get your hands on “Stages” stop what your doing now and order this, you won’t be disappointed.and like it your going to love this.

One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance. The songs are as catchy as ever and Shoot Out All the Lights contains a great call and response section. Motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doesn't change with the infectious Til The End. Every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale, a cover of the Rolling Stones' &#34;Sympathy for the Devil.&#34; Not very many bands could pull off a Stones cover, but HOLY CRAP does Motorhead SLAY this song! I was smiling from ear to ear. Lemmy doesn't try to mimic Jagger but instead puts his own unique snarling spin on the vocals while Phil plays a couple of perfect solos to compliment Dee's tight and fluid drumming. This album is pretty much perfect and this band needs a #1 in the U.S. so I urge you, if you want some talented classic metal in your life, pick this album up.

This album is crap, garbage, unlistenable (and I've listend to it twice and for the last time). Valentine must think he is the new Phil Spector only Valentine's production is a &#34;wall of noise&#34; not a &#34;wall of sound.&#34; What's with all of the gratuitous and excessive slaps, stomps, drum programming, catter-walling background vocals - even the keyboard and guitar parts are used for &#34;percussive&#34; effect rather than melody. Grace has a powerful and wonderful voice but it is wasted here and often seems mixed too far in the background. The songwriting is terrible. The overproduction makes almost very song sound the same. Some reviewers think this has a disco feel. I hated disco - but this is even worse. Some compare it to Britney Spears - this album makes Britney Spears and the Spice Girls sound talented. Grace - lose Valentine ASAP and get your head straight again.

I am sure most are already aware of this historic performance until now only available on bootlegs (with a chunk on Stages box, but poor sound IMO). But finally this incredible performance has been given the proper studio treatment it so deserves! Jimi had recently said goodbye to the Band of Gypsys and wanted to revamp the Experience. So he kept Billy Cox and recruited Mitch Mitchell back on drums. I want to say that some reviews in the past have said this was not one of his strongest performances, well I say BS! Remember, all we had to judge were the various boots floating around unless you were there and remember it or have some from the Stages box, but not complete and no where near this sound quality. So I had to have this on vinyl.(but I am sure the CD version is incredible as well) By the way, the first 5000 are limited edition numbered copies. I bought my copy from a local retailer because I had to have one of the limited copies. The sound quality is off the chart amazing! The band plays with the intensity of a run away train, and to hear Jimi just jam his guitar like no tomorrow is an incredible experience! Sony Legacy did as good a job as possible with the mastering of this incredible show! The set list is fantastic and if you are in to vinyl, this is the version to have! Great packaging and comes with a cool insert of pics and commentary. One of my favorite Rock n Roll lines ever comes after Fire, when Jimi says, I hope its not too loud for you, but if it is, we can always turn it up! Rock n Roll indeed!!!

Don't answer that. We've always been told not to judge a book by its cover; does the same go for CD cases? When I first saw the back of the CD case, my first thought was that they sure are pretty. Well, sometimes first impressions are right on the money, here you have a CD of pretty boys making pretty music.<br /><br />The opening song, \\\\\"All That I Am\\\\\" seemed very familiar to me, but I couldn't quite place if I'd heard it before, maybe as background music at the bar or maybe on the local college radio station. Of course, it could just be that the song has that generic sound that is so popular on mainstream radio the past several years, it seemed familiar without ever having heard it before.<br /><br />\\\\\"Losing Sleep\\\\\" is not a bad CD. The guys in the band are good musicians, and this effort can certainly compete with most of what is being offered by mainstream radio. Will Anderson does a respectable job with lyrics, and every now and then there is a moment of musical brilliance. He has a great voice, but I don't think it will ever be one of those voices that you can recognize in an instant, there is nothing stand-out about him or his style. If you like Maroon 5, The Fray, Coldplay and all of the other bands that sound like Maroon 5, The Fray and Coldplay, you'll like this band. If you are looking for a CD that will surprise you and give you something you've never heard before, keep looking, because you won't find it here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |2009-07-31 |\n",

Something great has been brewing over the last couple of years. Funky, gutbucket soul music is back! Not the canned, overblown, and ersatz junk you hear on TV singing contests and sitcoms but true 60's style R&B. Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse (yes, Amy Winehouse-she used Sharon Jones' backing band on Back to Black), and Raphael Saadiq are all doing their part to resurrect soul. And now Black Joe Lewis & the Honeybears have stepped up to the plate.<br /><br />Tell `Em What Your Name Is! is a gritty, storming, high energy debut album. Black Joe Lewis sings like James Brown and the Honeybears have that classic bass-and-horn driven Stax sound. That's right, it's like the Godfather of Soul fronting the Mar-Keys or Booker T. & the MGs. Talk about two great things that go great together--forget Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!<br /><br />If that doesn't mean anything to you, just listen to the samples. You'll be up and on your feet dancing in no time. Then, check out some [[ASIN:B000001DUP JB]] and [[ASIN:B000KP62UM Stax]] cuts and you'll see what I'm talkin' about.<br /><br />Now then, back to the album. It's pretty much funky soul all the way through, with a few blues tunes, including a Yardbirds style rave up and a Fat Possum-like Mississippi hill country droner, tossed in for good measure. Black Joe and the band play loud and hard on every track...don't go looking for any slow jams on this platter. The only real flaws are that the running time is kind of short and the music seems to have been mixed for iPod and computer listening, with every element of the music placed way upfront. These are merely quibbles, however, and don't take much away from what is a fun and enjoyable record.<br /><br />Bottom line: both old school and newer soul/R&B fans will dig this album. Strongly recommended.<br /><br />-----<br />This disc made me think of these...<br />[[ASIN:B000003BR8 It's Great When You're Straight...Yeah]]: Happy Mondays + Stax = Memphchester<br />[[ASIN:B000GIWS4W What It Is!]]: cool box set of obscure and rare soul cutsuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |2009-06-03 |\n",

I got Troubadour, I confess, because this hippie chick always liked reggae and I wanted to see how the musical elements were blended. My experience with Hip Hop is largely what I've heard blaring too loudly out of cars I'm stuck beside in traffic--that and the Sarah Palin SNL \\\\\"mother-lovin' moose\\\\\" skit--but those eyes rolling at me when I hurriedly roll up my window plus the knowledge that Hip Hop is sweeping the world in popularity made me want to educate myself so I'd be a little less square. (Well, that's the word we used to use for it. I have no idea what the same thing is in the current hip vernacular!)<br /><br />I have to say that I liked this CD more than I thought I would. First off, I was pleasantly surprised at how well K'naan enunciates his words. One of things I've disliked so much about rap lyrics is that I often cannot make out much more than the four-letter words; then what comes across is a bunch of anger and ugliness without much in the way of content to enlighten me and draw me in. This compilation is different. I can understand what's being said, and what's being said is often meaningful--and more broadly so--than most of the rap I've been exposed to has seemed to me. K'naan is just as adept as some infamous rappers at using those four-letter words, but they are used to good effect--not solely for their shock value or as a coded badge of entry for members of a narrowly circumscribed, exclusive little club.<br /><br />The way K'naan and his collaborators juxtapose rap rhythms with more traditional musical elements is appealing. When there is a spoken rap line, the elements backing it up are more melodic; when the vocals are sung (as on my favorite tracks), the beat is more rap-like. As for the non-rap elements, these I found most engaging. The African flavors are especially appealing, making me want to hear more. (That Paul Simon was so strongly criticized for trying to introduce African music to white Americans was an unfortunate musical setback at a time when a whole generation of Pop/Rock lovers was ready to open up to something new.)<br /><br />I personally enjoy the subtleties of Troubadour more than the up-front \\\\\"energetic\\\\\" aspects of it, although I suspect most Hip Hop fans might feel quite the opposite. I quickly tire of rap--I know a lot of my unhip friends do as well--but when used judiciously as an accent embedded in a larger mosaic of fresh sound, I find it enlivening.<br /><br />As it stands, Troubadour is not a CD I'd listen to in its entirety on a regular basis, but there are several tracks--the ones that made me get up and shake my booty in spite of myself--that I will definitely incorporate into my playlists. If K'naan can continue to evolve beyond \\\\\"just rap\\\\\" without betraying his roots, my sense is that he will be able to attract an audience far larger than the Hip Hop crowd.to introduce African music to white Americans was an unfortunate musical setback at a time when a whole generation of Pop/Rock lovers was ready to open up to something new.)<br /><br />I personally enjoy the subtleties of Troubadour more than the up-front \\\\\"energetic\\\\\" aspects of it, although I suspect most Hip Hop fans might feel quite the opposite.

After all, overproduction has a long tradition in rock going all the way back to Phil Spector.  Many of the \\\\\"progressive rock\\\\\" bands, like Yes and the Moody Blues, specialized in multi-layered opuses. Even today there are bands that are heirs apparent to that style, like Flaming Lips, Polyphonis Spree, and Arcade Fire.  This band does \\\\\"overproduction\\\\\" quite well, and they definitely put across the image of a neo-hippie, hedonistic lifestyle.  Just watch their hyper-psychedelic video of \\\\\"Time to Pretend\\\\\" and you'll know where their heads are at, as they used to say back in the `60's.  That leadoff track gets the album off to a joyous start, and even if you don't subscribe to the drug-culture lifestyle they seem to espouse (sardonically or otherwise - this song is probably one of the factors that earned them an \\\\\"explicit lyrics\\\\\" label), you have to admit it's a fun and freewheeling track.  In fact, there's a lot of bohemian fun and loose song structure throughout this album, infused with some often \\\\\"retro\\\\\" engineering tricks.  Another standout track is \\\\\"Electric Feel\\\\\", where they lay down one of the funkiest '70's-style grooves I've heard in some time.  The energy level seems to flag a little in the latter half, but overall it's an enjoyable, if rather lightweight album, the kind you'll like to play on your car stereo on a warm spring day with the windows down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |2008-05-06 |\n",

Definitely original!|This album is like nothing I've seen or heard. My first reaction was \\\\\"oh, that hurt\\\\\", as I got a headache just trying to comprehend it all. The initial track on the album \\\\\"Time to Pretend\\\\\" sounds rather euphoric and dissonant, like someone was on an acid trip when they thought it up. Well, when you actually see their music video for this song, it all becomes rather clear and apparent. I like the retro modern feel of it all. It makes you feel like someone put the 1990's and 1960's in a blender and added a few helpings of crack-laced vodka for feel. Not for everyone, but if you \\\\\"don't mind experimenting\\\\\" and are \\\\\"open to new things\\\\\", whatever that might mean, I think it's an album that you might enjoy.

The overall result is a well-delivered and interesting mix of very good songs.  The more times I hear it, the better it sounds.<br /><br />The first few times around a few tracks overpowered the album.  Yet the last four tracks were so strong, I decided to listen to it again a few times.  I put on my trusty headset to really focus in on the music.  Sure enough, I heard a lot of great elements I had missed.<br /><br />Ms. Moorer's musical pedigree has been well touted in her bio.  When you've been nominated for a Grammy award on a major record label, people do tend to take notice.  Perhaps the excessive hype hurt my expectations, especially when she's described as a \\\\\"technically gifted vocalist.\\\\\"<br /><br />I'm sure the number crunchers decided that by adding some well-known covers they could be sure her songs would get played at Gap stores and restaurants everywhere.  By and large they've succeeded.  Those songs will get this record played, though they are not my favorite parts of this album.<br /><br />Her take on \\\\\"Both Sides Now\\\\\" has a tighter musical arrangement and seems more suited to her voice than the other remakes.  \\\\\"Ring of Fire,\\\\\" \\\\\"I Want a Little Sugar In My Bowl,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Daddy Goodbye Blues\\\\\" have each grown on me but could have all been improved.<br /><br />\\\\\"Ring of Fire\\\\\" as done here highlights a subtle recording choice.  The vocals were clearly not leveled.  You can hear her as she gyrates closer and further from the microphone.  This seems to have been intentional, as recording engineers love to give songs that \\\\\"live\\\\\" recorded feel.  The vocal overlays seem to be fighting against the instrumentals on this song.  The sound engineers seem to have magnified this too for effect.  You have to improve more upon the original when you're putting your name on a song.  I'm still not crazy about the musical arrangement on this track, convinced it sounds too much like the Christmas classic \\\\\"The Little Drummer Boy.\\\\\"  Yet I've grown to appreciate her take on the song more.<br /><br />Both \\\\\"I Want a Little Sugar In My Bowl\\\\\" and \\\\\"Daddy Goodbye Blues\\\\\" have a blues treatment that was off-putting at first but sounded better on subsequent listens.  As a huge Nina Simone [[ASIN:B00009PJPJ Anthology]] fan, I'm probably in a very hard-to-please group.  I didn't mind the hollow recording on \\\\\"Daddy Goodbye Blues\\\\\" as much as some others.  In the end these two tracks, though nice, seem misplaced here.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are 1, 3, and 9-12.  \\\\\"Mockingbird,\\\\\" \\\\\"She Knows Where She Goes,\\\\\" \\\\\"Where is My Love\\\\\" and \\\\\"I'm Looking for Blue Eyes\\\\\" are all beautiful smooth ballads.  Each song has a nice mix of folk and country that lends to a recognizable sound.  And \\\\\"Orphan Train\\\\\" really stands out as well.  They really showcase Allison Moorer at her best here.<br /><br />I liked her broad genre treatment, which reminded me of several Lyle Lovett albums I love.  \\\\\"Dancing Barefoot\\\\\" and \\\\\"Revelator\\\\\" each have more of an upbeat alternative rock feel with hints of folk.  Those songs showcase the best crossover appeal of this album.<br /><br />No doubt \\\\\"Ring of Fire\\\\\" will get notice in these remake obsessed times.  Yet there is so much more on this album that is interesting and compelling.<br /><br />For fans of:<br /><br />Trisha Yearwood [[ASIN:B0010X5WXQ Love Songs]]<br />Corinne Bailey Rae [[ASIN:B000HBK3MM Corinne Bailey Rae]]<br />Joni Mitchell [[ASIN:B000UR366S Shine]]<br />Judy Collins [[ASIN:B000002I26 Wildflowers]]<br />Nora Jones [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]]<br />Lyle Lovett [[ASIN:B000RIWAS0 It's Not Big It's Large]]<br />Emmylou Harris [[ASIN:B0009NR7YU The Very Best of Emmylou Harris: Heartaches and Highways]]<br />KT Tunstall [[ASIN:B000DN5VJY Eye to the Telescope]]<br /><br />Enjoy.rummer Boy.\\\\\"  Yet I've grown to appreciate her take on the song more.

Same for their version of \\\\\"Over the Hills and Far Away,\\\\\" which was a surprising and especial treat for a Sean Bean/Sharpe's Adventures fan like myself.<br /><br />The CD, however, is not pure pipes and drums.  There is an orchestra with flutes, cellos and violins involved here.  And, to be honest, the slick orchestration and vocals on some of the tracks tend to detract from the beauty of the pipes, leaving the work with an almost new age sound.
